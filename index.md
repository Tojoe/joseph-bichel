Hello! Welcome to my website! My name is Joseph Bichel and I am in my fourth year of Engineering Physics at the University of British Columbia. I am passionate about engineering and I thrive in teams that share my passion! My strongest skill set lies in hardware development (design and validation) and I am committed to develop my mechanical design, CAD skill set, and programming ability. Ultimately, I hope to engage in solving tough problems that lie in industries such as automotives, robotics, and product design.
