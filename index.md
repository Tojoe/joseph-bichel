Hello! Welcome to my website where I promote my work and experience. As am a fourth year Engineering Physics at the University of British Columbia, I am passionate about engineering and I thrive in teams that are also passionate about engineering! My strongest skill set lies in hardware development (design and validation) and I have recently committed to developing my mechanical design and CAD skill set and programming ability. Ultimately, I hope to engage in tough problems that lie in the intersections of fields that require a unique combination of strengths to tackle, such as in automotives, robotics, and product design.
