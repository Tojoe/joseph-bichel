Hello! Welcome to my website! My name is Joseph Bichel and I am in my fourth year of Engineering Physics at the University of British Columbia. I am passionate about engineering and I thrive in teams that are also passionate about engineering! My strongest skill set lies in hardware development (design and validation) and I have recently committed to developing my mechanical design and CAD skill set and programming ability. Ultimately, I hope to engage in tough problems that lie in the intersections of fields that require a unique combination of strengths to tackle, such as in automotives, robotics, and product design.
