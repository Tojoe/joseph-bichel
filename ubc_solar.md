UBC Solar is a student-led engineering design team at the University of British Columbia. The team has a well-defined goal: to build a solar-powered vehicle and to race on the international stage in the Formula Sun Grand Prix and American Solar Challenge hosted by the Innovators Education Foundation (IEF).

I had the pleasure of co-leading the team administration and leading the electrical division from January 2018 to August 2019. In that time, I lead the team through the development of its third solar car since UBC Solar's inception in 1996. I was responsible for managing the organization of 50 members and the finances of a $100 000 budget. We designed the car from the ground up with little prior documentation or connections to the rest of the solar car world. It was a chaotic 20 months, and an experience that shaped who I am as a person, a leader and an engineer.

## Co-Captain
As Co-Captain, I was responsible for administrative work to keep the team operational, this included:
 - Creating a budget and managing the finances of the team 
 - Writing sponsorship and grant applications
 - Leading a weekly meeting including a team-wide presentations, updates and a scrum
 - Acting as the teamâ€™s liaison to the Faculty of Applied Science at UBC, the competition organizers - Innovators Education Foundation (IEF), and the international solar car community
 - Organizing team safety training and procedures
 
As head of the team I learned what made this organization so specicial. The document linked below is an example of a report we would send to our supporters. The Daniel's Family Foundation recommited $60 000 over three years while I was co-captain. The admin team and I worked hard to make this happen.

During my time at UBC Solar I reimagined the structure of the team. I became electrical lead without a proper leadership and it was a very stressful experience. We needed a way to ingrain the knowledge we spent so long to achieve. One of the solutions to solidify this organizational knowledge was to develop a strong administrative team presence.

## Electrical Lead
As Electrical Lead, I was responsible to organise and synchronize the four subteams under the electrical division. These subteams include:
 - Power Electronics : Responsible for design specifications and selecting components for the motor, motor controller, maximum power-point trackers and solar array
 - Battery : Responsible for the design of the high-voltage battery pack and the low-voltage battery management system
 - Low-voltage Systems : Responsible auxiliary low-voltage systems and boards such as: the dashboard, connectors, main control node
 - Software :  Responsible for the firmware for in-house designed boards and the software for the data management website
 
Specifically, I worked with a group of leads that then organised the members of their subteam, this entailed:
 - Developing a timeline of major milestones and working with subteam leads to develop gantt charts on a team-by-team basis
 - Twice-a-week meetings to talk through designs, and to address development gates
 - Helping subteam leads find resources through research or campus connections
 - Developing budgets for each subteam
 
As head of the electrical team I was vetted the design, purchasing and manufacturing of the electrical system. Knowing the system inside-out was necessary for the submission of the electrical design report to the competition officials. I will speak to many details shortly, but this document is a strong summary. <br/>

## Technical Details

In this section I will speak to some technical details of the project.

### Power Electronics

<p><span class="image left"><img src="assets\images\NGM_on_it's_face.jpg" alt="" /></span> This our solar cars in-hub motor, an NGM SCM150. <br/> To use an in-hub motor is a common practice in the solar vehicle building. Specially built motors fit torque requirements of the light vehicle,and demand a suitable power from the battery pack. Most critically, high efficiencies without drivetrain losses are ideal when each watt of solar power is precious. In design we had originally opted not to use this motor, because it is almost double the weight of similarly efficient/powerful motors. We made a concession because this motor was almost an eighth the price of the "ideal motor". </p>

<p><span class="image right"><img src="assets\images\solar_testing.jpg" alt="" /></span> <br/><br/><br/><br/> Here is an example of the cars solar array. In this photo we are conducting a functionality test of the Maximum Power-Point Tracker (MPPT). This particular MPPT is a boost converter selected so that the 60V solar arrays strings could charge the 100.8V battery pack. Two 12V lead-acid batteries were used as a load. We measured the input and output voltages and currents to make sure everything was acting as expected. It was! </p>
