UBC Solar is a student-led engineering design team at the University of British Columbia. The team has a well-defined goal: to build a solar-powered vehicle to compete on the international stage in the Formula Sun Grand Prix and American Solar Challenge.

I had the pleasure of co-leading the team administration and leading the electrical division from January 2018 to August 2019. In that time, I lead the team through the development of its third solar car since the teams inception in 1996. I was responsible for managing the organization of 50 members and the finances of a $100 000 budget. We designed the car from the ground up with little prior documentation or connections to the rest of the solar car world. It was a chaotic 20 months, and an experience that shaped who I am as a person, a leader and an engineer.
