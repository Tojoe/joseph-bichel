UBC Solar is a student-led engineering design team at the University of British Columbia. The team has a well-defined goal: to build a solar-powered vehicle and to race on the international stage in the Formula Sun Grand Prix and American Solar Challenge hosted by the Innovators Education Foundation (IEF).

I had the pleasure of co-leading the team administration and leading the electrical division from January 2018 to August 2019. In that time, I lead the team through the development of its third solar car since UBC Solar's inception in 1996. I was responsible for managing the organization of 50 members and the finances of a $100 000 budget. We designed the car from the ground up with little prior documentation or connections to the rest of the solar car world. It was a chaotic 20 months, and an experience that shaped who I am as a person, a leader and an engineer.

### As Co-Captain
I was responsible for administrative work to keep the team operational, this included:
 - Creating a budget and managing the finances of the team 
 - Writing sponsorship and grant applications
 - Leading a weekly meeting including a team-wide presentations, updates and a scrum
 - Acting as the teamâ€™s liaison to the Faculty of Applied Science at UBC, the competition organizers - Innovators Education Foundation (IEF), and the international solar car community
 - Organizing team safety training and procedures
 
As head of the team I learned what made this organization so specicial. The document linked below is an example of a report we would send to our supporters. The Daniel's Family Foundation recommited $60 000 over three years while I was co-captain. The admin team and I worked hard to make this happen.

During my time at UBC Solar I reimagined the structure of the team. I became electrical lead without a proper leadership and it was a very stressful experience. We needed a way to ingrain the knowledge we spent so long to achieve. One of the solutions to solidify this organizational knowledge was to develop a strong administrative team presence. 


### As Electrical Lead
I was responsible to organise and synchronize the four subteams under the electrical division. These subteams include:
 - Power Electronics : Responsible for design specifications and selecting components for the motor, motor controller, maximum power-point trackers and solar array
 - Battery : Responsible for the design of the high-voltage battery pack and the low-voltage battery management system
 - Low-voltage Systems : Responsible auxiliary low-voltage systems and boards such as: the dashboard, connectors, main control node
 - Software :  Responsible for the firmware for in-house designed boards and the software for the data management website
 
Specifically, I worked with a group of leads that then organised the members of their subteam, this entailed:
 - Developing a timeline of major milestones and working with subteam leads to develop gantt charts on a team-by-team basis
 - Twice-a-week meetings to talk through designs, and to address development gates
 - Helping subteam leads find resources through research or campus connections
 - Developing budgets for each subteam
